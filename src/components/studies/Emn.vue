        <h4>Projects</h4>
        <h4>Openstack distribution</h4>
        <p>
          Worked on the distribution of Openstack. We had to study the modules to find out
          which ones would be difficult to distribute and what problems could be encountered
          due to this different architecture.
        </p>
        <h4>Sound & Light</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of the project was to synchronize the sound coming out from a controller
          Dj or a music file with a video projector. The user can choose between a full
          screen or forms. We used java with a graphical library: processing and a sound
          one: minim. We chose the observer pattern and to work with github in order to
          work on the same project at the same time. Here is the GitHub repository.

        <h4>Associations</h4>
        <h4>Student’s Association Webmaster</h4>
        <p>
        Maintained as a Webmaster a php website. It enabled me to put into practice
        what I had learned about web development and how to design and maintain a
        website and its ERP-like software developed by school students.
        </p>
        <h4>Junior Enterprise - Project Manager</h4>
        <p>
        Interacted between the client and the others parties in order to define project
        specifications and see if the client’s needs and the student’s capabilities are
        compatible in order to carry out the project, either in computer science or in
        web development.
