        <p>
          Worked as a security consultant intern for six month on agile integration in
          development processes. In that context, I had first, to familiarize myself
          with what characterize an agile methodology, then I studied methodologies in
          use to integrate security in the development processes before combining the
          two and create a new methodology. At the same time, I participated to two
          missions, the first one was on an Information Security Management System,
          how to choose risks and link them to the characteristics of the company.
          The second mission was to write security policies and the corresponding
          procedures for an insurance company. To do that we had to interview all the
          staff in relation to security and then adapt or create the documents.
