        <h2>Production Trainee</h2>
        <h4>Degrémont</h4>
        <p>
          As part of my Master, I made an Internship at Degrémont as a Production Trainee.
          In that context, I had first to develop a precise and reliable way to measure
          plastic tile thickness. I had also to analyse data I collected all along the
          production line to determine the cause of production waste for a certain type
          of tile. These projects allowed me to work and collaborate with all kinds of
          people : I had to communicate with operators in order for them to understand
          what I was doing and get their help and approval, I had to communicate with the
          management, to explain how I was doing, where I was in my research. In a Company
          all the services are interconnected and a good intern communication is really
          important for the work to be done.
