        <p>
          I am a software engineer on the application enabling the car sharing system
          Autolibâ€™ or BlueSG.
          We use Python and Django for the backend with different technologies for the
          frontend. I mainly worked on the subscriptions and finance part of the backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I researched GraphQL and its Python implementation, Graphene, as part of my activities. My
          work was presented at the DjangoConFr and PyconFr 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also looked into how we could improve our development workflow and in
          particular, how we could use our Jenkins CI better get closer to a CI/CD automation.
